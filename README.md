Portfolio Optimization System Overview
Purpose
This system helps investors create efficient investment portfolios by finding the optimal mix of assets that provides the best balance of risk and return. It uses Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to determine how much to invest in each asset while considering both potential returns and risks.
Main Components
Data Processing
The system takes historical returns data for different investments (like stocks or bonds) and calculates:

Average returns for each investment
How the investments move in relation to each other (covariance)
Overall portfolio performance metrics

Portfolio Optimization
The system finds the best combination of investments by:

Maximizing the ratio of returns to risk (Sharpe ratio)
Ensuring all investments add up to 100%
Preventing negative investment amounts (no short-selling)

Key Features
The system calculates three main metrics:

Expected annual return of the portfolio
Annual risk (volatility)
Risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio)
