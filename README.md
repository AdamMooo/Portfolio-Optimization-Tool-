__**Portfolio Optimization System Overview:**__

**Purpose:**
This system helps investors create efficient investment portfolios by finding the optimal mix of assets that provides the best balance of risk and return. It uses Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to determine how    much to invest in each asset while considering both potential returns and risks.

**Data Processing:**
The system takes historical returns data for different investments (like stocks or bonds) and calculates:

    - Average returns for each investment
    - How the investments move in relation to each other (covariance)
    - Overall portfolio performance metrics

**Portfolio Optimization:**
    - The system finds the best combination of investments by:
    
    - Maximizing the ratio of returns to risk (Sharpe ratio)
    - Ensuring all investments add up to 100%
    - Preventing negative investment amounts (no short-selling)

**Key Features:**
The system calculates three main metrics:

    - Expected annual return of the portfolio
    - Annual risk (volatility)
    - Risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio)

**Practical Benefits:**

    - Easy to use with simple inputs
    - Provides clear investment recommendations
    - Works with any number of assets
    - Gives realistic portfolio allocations

**Use:**
The system requires only historical return data to work. It can be used to:

    - Create new investment portfolios
    - Analyze existing portfolios
    - Make portfolio adjustments over time

**Limitations:**

    - Relies on historical data
    - Provides point-in-time analysis
    - May need periodic updates as markets change
